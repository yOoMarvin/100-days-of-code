# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a rework of my quote-machine.

**Thoughts:** Nothing special. Just getting into it and do something! I like the project and it was not that hard. I played a bit with another API with HTTPS and an API key, but it was to complicated to hide the key on github. Wanted to make the project visible over github pages, but the problem here is, that it is not allowed to get data from http connections. In the end I've just written a readme with the link to the new project on codepen. Check it out :)
