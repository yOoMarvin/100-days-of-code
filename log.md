# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a rework of my quote-machine.

**Thoughts:** Nothing special. Just getting into it and do something! I like the project and it was not that hard. I played a bit with another API with HTTPS and an API key, but it was to complicated to hide the key on github. Wanted to make the project visible over github pages, but the problem here is, that it is not allowed to get data from http connections. In the end I've just written a readme with the link to the new project on codepen. Check it out :)

###Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Have made some progress on my FrontEndCertificate at FreeCodeCamp. Also worked a bit with npm and node.js. Nothing project related, just some foundations for future work. In the end of the day I've started my rework of the local weather webapp. And I tried a few things with heroku to deploy my apps.

**Thoughts**: Fun day, learned a lot new stuff. I think a solid foundation is really important for future projects. I have not coded that much, but still accomplished a lot.

###Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finisehd the rework of the local weather app.

**Thoughts**: Again nothing too complicated today. Just getting things started. Building foundations and making more complex stuff in the future is a goal.

###Day 4: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project for my FrontEndCertificate. The wikipedia viewer. Also did some node tutorials.

**Thoughts**: Things getting better and easier. I can start new projects faster and get the basic stuff done a lot faster.

###Day 5: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the wiki viewer. Also read a lot about javascript.

**Thoughts**: Feeling better and a lot fast. I've already learned a lot, but I think I have to get more comfortable with JavaScript... Continue reading more and do more stuff in the future!
