# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a rework of my quote-machine.

**Thoughts:** Nothing special. Just getting into it and do something! I like the project and it was not that hard. I played a bit with another API with HTTPS and an API key, but it was to complicated to hide the key on github. Wanted to make the project visible over github pages, but the problem here is, that it is not allowed to get data from http connections. In the end I've just written a readme with the link to the new project on codepen. Check it out :)

###Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Have made some progress on my FrontEndCertificate at FreeCodeCamp. Also worked a bit with npm and node.js. Nothing project related, just some foundations for future work. In the end of the day I've started my rework of the local weather webapp. And I tried a few things with heroku to deploy my apps.

**Thoughts**: Fun day, learned a lot new stuff. I think a solid foundation is really important for future projects. I have not coded that much, but still accomplished a lot.

###Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finisehd the rework of the local weather app.

**Thoughts**: Again nothing too complicated today. Just getting things started. Building foundations and making more complex stuff in the future is a goal.

###Day 19: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Rework of the existing hot url ios app.

**Thoughts**: On the branch rework I've made some adjustments and tried some things out. The goal was just to make some changes to the existing code. Get out of that comfort zone. And this was a good idea! Loose the fear of changing stuff is important! Already have some ideas in my mind for the next features

**Link to work**: [hoturl github repository](https://github.com/yOoMarvin/hoturl)

###Day 20: January 26, 2017

###Day 22: January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Paused the hoturl app because of a problem and started a new one!

**Thoughts**: I've had some trouble with the app group of the hot url for the share extension. Some stuff with the certificate of the apple account. So I will pause this one until I've figured out a solution. But I've already started a new app! It it a converter for several color codes. Today I've made the design and concept and I think it will be reaaaally nice! Stay tuned!

**Today's Progress**: Discovered Code Wars and really got lost into it.

**Thoughts**: Code Wars is awesome! It's such an awesome feeling when you find a challenge that won't get out of your head and you need to solve it. I really want to master swift and I guess this is good way. Some iOS apps and additionally some general coding challenges. Maybe I will be doing a repo with some katas of swift. Oh, I also discovered some nice screencasts, youtube channels, medium publications and podcasts on ios and swift. Really diving deep into it now!

###Day 30: February 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Good Day. Started the rework of the app!

**Thoughts**: And I'm back at it. Still ill, but it's getting better. Lay down in bed and start coding! The rework of the concept of the app was really important. This time I made the things simpler and with more ease. I can still do the harder stuff in the future, I have time. Good day today. Have to keep it up! Also I have to rework the UI of the app, the old link is outdated.

###Day 31: February 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did the other part of the logic for converting and fixed some bugs. Also improved the structure

**Thoughts**: Really productive day! But dude, I have to get better and think more about my changes and the stuff. Maybe I should dive more into test driven development with swift. I think this would make things a lot easier. But still, I fixed a lot of stuff today and did the major part of the apps logic. Tomorrow I will try to make the interface nice and add some nice to have stuff.

**Thoughts**: Init a new project and I have to say that basic stuff goes fast now. So fast I've totally forgot to commit changes. Still stuck at the stuff which is new but I guess that is normal. I think this project will be done fast, because it isn't a large topic. Already planning for something new.
