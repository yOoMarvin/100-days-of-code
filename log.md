# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a rework of my quote-machine.

**Thoughts:** Nothing special. Just getting into it and do something! I like the project and it was not that hard. I played a bit with another API with HTTPS and an API key, but it was to complicated to hide the key on github. Wanted to make the project visible over github pages, but the problem here is, that it is not allowed to get data from http connections. In the end I've just written a readme with the link to the new project on codepen. Check it out :)

###Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Have made some progress on my FrontEndCertificate at FreeCodeCamp. Also worked a bit with npm and node.js. Nothing project related, just some foundations for future work. In the end of the day I've started my rework of the local weather webapp. And I tried a few things with heroku to deploy my apps.

**Thoughts**: Fun day, learned a lot new stuff. I think a solid foundation is really important for future projects. I have not coded that much, but still accomplished a lot.
