# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a rework of my quote-machine.

**Thoughts:** Nothing special. Just getting into it and do something! I like the project and it was not that hard. I played a bit with another API with HTTPS and an API key, but it was to complicated to hide the key on github. Wanted to make the project visible over github pages, but the problem here is, that it is not allowed to get data from http connections. In the end I've just written a readme with the link to the new project on codepen. Check it out :)

###Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Have made some progress on my FrontEndCertificate at FreeCodeCamp. Also worked a bit with npm and node.js. Nothing project related, just some foundations for future work. In the end of the day I've started my rework of the local weather webapp. And I tried a few things with heroku to deploy my apps.

**Thoughts**: Fun day, learned a lot new stuff. I think a solid foundation is really important for future projects. I have not coded that much, but still accomplished a lot.

###Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finisehd the rework of the local weather app.

**Thoughts**: Again nothing too complicated today. Just getting things started. Building foundations and making more complex stuff in the future is a goal.

###Day 9: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: New project! Bitcoin price checker for the web!

**Thoughts**: I started a new project today. I've made a bitcoin price checker in the past for iOS and wanted to do this for the web now! So I created the project structure and coded the basic stuff like layout and style. Good work today!

###Day 10: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: After a little break I'm back with my new project and it goes really well!

**Thoughts**: Little break over the weekend. But I had absolutely no problem to get back into it. Today i did another API request and things are getting better and better. Next: Try to visualize data with d3.

###Day 12: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the bitcoin webapp and worked myself through some node.js stuff.

**Thoughts**: It wasn't a big problem to add the graph to the bitcoin page, but d3 isn't that easy. Still got it to work nicely. Getting more familiar with node.js
